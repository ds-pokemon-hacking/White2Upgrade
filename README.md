# Pokémon White 2 Upgrade
Pokémon White 2 Upgrade is a project that aims to bring new features to Pokémon Black 2 & White 2, including (but not limited to):
- Dex Expansion (Pokemon from newer generations)
- Move Expansion (moves from newer generations)
- Type Expansion (Fairy Type)
- Ability Expansion (abilities from newer generations)
- Modern Battle Mechanics

Additionally, this serves as a template for code-injection heavy ROM hacks, as the underlying mechanisms can be used to easily extend functionality in whatever direction the user would like.

## Current Features
**Please note: this project is a heavy work in progress. As such, there will be some rough edges.**
- Expanded Pokédex (currently up to 721).
- Fairy type.
